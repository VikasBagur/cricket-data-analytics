# Cricket-Data-Analytics

## Objective: 

To prepare a cricket team of 11 men T20 players based on the data from recently concluded T20 World Cup (WC, Oct 2022) and selection criteria for each role of the player. 
The team should be capable of scoring at least 180 runs on an average and be able to defend 150 runs on an average.

## Data:

Please refer to appendix 1 or the python script attached for the code explanation.
1.	Data was collected from espncricinfo.com by web scraping using Python.
2.	The extracted data was transformed using Python and Power BI.
3.	The cleaned data was visualized using Power BI. [Power BI Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiOWFiODEyMmEtYmNhMy00MjFkLWJhMzYtYjI0ZDQ3NTRiMGIxIiwidCI6IjlkZGFhY2ExLTM4OWYtNGNiMS1hMTEzLTA4MWJlNmNjMjVmYyIsImMiOjZ9)

## My learnings from the project:
1.	This project is based on this [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QkYy1wANXA&t=4750s). But I have made some changes to it.
2.	I learnt to scrape the web using Python which led me to learn more about Beautiful Soup library and allowed me to get more familiarized with Python. In the video, they have used a website and Java Script to scrape the data.
3.	I used Python to clean the data.
4.	Power BI. It was a new tool for me, and the video just gave the basics of it and I learnt how to use it to create better visualizations.  

## Recommendations:

**Playing 11:**

|     Openers      |	Middle Order     |    Finishers   | All Rounder	| Specialist Pacers   |
|------------------|---------------------|----------------|-------------|---------------------|
|  Jos Buttler (c) |    Virat Kohli      | Curtis Campher | Shadab Khan	|    Sam Curran       |
|   Alex Hales     |  Suryakumar Yadav   |  Glenn Maxwell |	        |   Anrich Nortje     |
|	           |   Glenn Phillips	 |	          |             | Shaheen Shah Afridi |

**Reasons:**

Please refer to appendix 2 for explanation of terms.
1.	***Openers: Jos Buttler and Alex Hales***

 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65936796/221319159-9c403871-c31e-4f6b-8867-80430b2c5299.png)

a.	Openers are considered as power hitters and are expected to set the foundation for the rest of the batting innings.

b.	We see from the image that both have batting averages above 40 which is highest among their peers.

c.	Their strike rate is in the 140s, which is not the highest, but it is good for openers given their high batting average and total innings batted. This means that they have the capacity to bat long without losing their wicket, and have the capacity to bat explosively.

d.	They both are right-handed batsmen. If a right-hand and left-hand batting combination is required, then Rilee Rossouw could be played in place of Alex Hales.

2.	***Middle Order: Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav and Glenn Phillips***

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65936796/221319304-dc176d11-599b-4540-b7e4-0c166562a7de.png)

a.	Middle order batters create an anchor when wickets are falling and stabilize the scoring rate. If they donâ€™t lose their wicket till the end, they should be able to score at a high rate too.

b.	Virat Kohli was chosen for his impressive batting average. He was the leading run scorer in the tournament. He will be able to steady the ship and play till the end of the innings allowing other players to play aggressively.

c.	Suryakumar Yadav was chosen for his impressive strike rate. He could be the perfect aggressive batsman who could score at a higher rate. If he stays till the end of the innings, he can be a good finisher as well.

d.	Glenn Phillips was chosen for balance. He can steady the ship or play aggressively depending on the situation as he has a good batting average and a higher strike rate.

e.	The order of Glenn Philips and Suryakumar Yadav can be changed based on the playing conditions.

3.	***Finishers: Curtis Campher and Glenn Maxwell***

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65936796/221319374-fcc84620-e017-4fae-b10c-ece401104b5d.png)
 
a.	They come out to bat during the end part of the innings and try to score big in the least number of balls. So, they need to have higher batting strike rate. It also helps if they can also bowl. They might have to also steady the batting innings if wickets are falling rapidly. Hence, it is good if they have a good batting average too.

b.	I have recommended 2 finishers for 2 reasons:

    a. They both have similar stats and bat at a position which usually plays at the end of the innings.

    b. These 2 are also all-rounders, meaning there will be more options to bowl with. Glenn can bowl off spins, which is effective against left-handed batsman, and Curtis can bowl pace. Both can bowl during the powerplay overs.

4.	***All-rounder: Shadab Khan***
 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65936796/221320003-25b7b863-3532-481b-953d-8e75c179e461.png)

a.	These are players who have the capacity to bowl and bat. 

b.	Since we already have 2 all-rounders playing as finishers, I will recommend having Shadab Khan who can bowl leg spin.

c.	He has the best bowling economy and a good bowling and batting strike rate. With his leg spin, he can trouble the batsman and score good runs at a good rate if required.

5.	***Specialist Pacers: Sam Curran, Anrich Nortje, Shaheen Shah Afridi***

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65936796/221320022-cb8af55f-5888-4edc-bb19-22b3c2aec5e2.png)
 
a.	Sam Curran and Shaheen Shah Afridi are left-handed pacers, who are very effective against right-handed batsman. They can bowl during the powerplay and death overs.

b.	Sam Curran has the capacity to bat as well and will come in handy if required to bat.

c.	Anrich Nortje can be used to control runs during the middle overs (Over no. 7 to 16) along with the spinners.

d.	Shaheen and Anrich can bowl at speed of 150 km/hr., a feat that only a few people have achieved in the cricketing world.

***What is a T20 Cricket?***

It is a shorter format of cricket played between 2 teams. There are 2 innings in the game with 20 overs each. During an inning, one team will bat, and the other team will bowl and vice versa in the second innings. The team batting first will put a target for the second team to score.
